- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
There is no way we are logging and tracking which users are performing which actions. Logging the various user information 
for each message. For every incoming path, the middleware function creates a log entry which contains the IP address. 
And then we save that data in a private file which is only accessible to the root admin of this particular service. 

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Instead of storing the logs on the file system, we  could store the logs in MongoDB since MongoDB has some safeguards. 
Additionally, we can add more information to the log. Doing some automatic auditing so that certain logs can be
flagged in our system and then checked later on.
