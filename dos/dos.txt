- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability is that we're doing a query based on id and that id is coming from potentially an attacker controlled input which is not sanitized. 
While it's preventing noSQL attacks, we still need to do error handling and sanitize the input in order to prevent a 
denial of service attack.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Adding some error handling such as adding a try catch block on the query that finds the user by the id. 
Also, we can sanitize the data that is input and used for the query. We should also limit any requests that comes into the server for certain periods of time.
This can be done by using some rate limiting middleware.
