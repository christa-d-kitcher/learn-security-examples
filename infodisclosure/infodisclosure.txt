Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability is that the "username" input currently does not sanitize the input meaning that the user can input
a regular expression for example, which will give this user the username and password information from the database. 
In this case, the regular expression brings back the result of the first user's username and password. The secure 
version prevents the vulnerability by ensuring that the input for username is always a string.


Which CIA property does tampering violate?
It violates confidentiality.


What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Authentication and access control. As well as removing all console logs, as well as storing the password using hashing with some kind of algorithm.
