- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability is that we're not authenticating the user that is able to access that endpoint which directs to the page where one can 
input the user id and role to update. This means that a malicious user can potentially enter in the user id of an admin and 
deescalate that admin's role to a user. 

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Have checks based on the fact that there is a valid session but then also using 2 factor authentication by using
custom middleware functions or by sending a token from the server to the client.
